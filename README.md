# Svelte Example

This is a simple example of a Svelte app that uses the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework.
This project is mostly based on https://github.com/MikeTeddyOmondi/todo-svelte-app but updated to use Svelte 5.

- Obviously this is for learning purposes only. You probably don't want to use it as your actual todo app. 🤷‍♀️

## Quick start:

- `nvm use lts`
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev --open`
